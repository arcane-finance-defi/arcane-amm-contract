## What is AMM?
A Constant Product Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized trading mechanism used in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to facilitate the exchange of assets in a liquidity pool. This type of AMM operates based on a mathematical equation that maintains a constant product of the quantities of two different tokens held in the pool. As users trade one token for another, the quantities of the tokens change in such a way that the product of their quantities remains constant.
